    Implement this initializer to finalise your `Form` object. It is called
    by the `Form` itself after your form is constructed with

        let formResult = FormObject.validating(request.context)
        guard case .success(let form) = formResult ...

    The values in `validated` are guaranteed to be valid for your `Fieldset`.
    In this initializer, you must map from each field to your struct or class's
    properties, like so:

        self.name = validated["name"]!.string

    If implicitly unwrapping your optionals is not something you would like to do,
    or if you need to perform 'whole-form' validation, this initializer throws so
    that you can throw an error:

        guard let name = validated["name"]?.string else { throw FormIncorrectlyConfigured }

    If you don't want a direct 1:1 mapping of fields to form values, you should do
    work on the validated values before storing them in your form instance. For example,
    uppercasing or lowercasing strings, combining two or more fields into a new field.
